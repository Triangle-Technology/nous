//! Diagnostic: what does `thalamic_gate` classify the perplexity-eval
//! text categories as?
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --example gate_classification_diagnose`
//!
//! The CR5 gate-conditioning fix in `compute_delta_modulation` only activates
//! on `GateType::Routine` inputs. For the fix to help the Technical-category
//! regression observed in `examples/perplexity_eval.rs` (HS arousal produced
//! +2.37% perplexity), thalamic_gate must classify the Technical text as
//! Routine when it passes through `CognitiveSession::process_message`.
//!
//! If Technical → Routine: the fix helps end-to-end (just needs a pipeline-
//! integrated perplexity eval to demonstrate).
//!
//! If Technical → Novel: the fix doesn't help perplexity on this text
//! because the gate still says "process this". The regression needs a
//! different surgical fix (e.g., valence-conditioning, or confidence-based
//! damping).
